                            — Our agency has a content plan for models that clearly describes what kind of photos and videos we need for a successful account, as well as their quantity. For one work month we ask for about 40-50 photos and 20-30 videos. This content plan is very flexible and always adapts to the model, taking into account all the nuances of the possibility (or not) of shooting a particular type of content.

                        <p class="faq__item-answer transition">
                            — Most often models send new content in its entirety every beginning of the month. But it's also possible to divide the content plan into parts, so you can send half the content at the beginning of the month and half in the middle.

                            — Of course there is! The percentage goes up when a model makes progress in shooting content, does it well, and the sales go up accordingly.

                            Before your agency, I went through a total of three agencies that didn't develop my account, didn't always pay my salary, and were rude to models. And I am very glad that I came across you. You pulled my account from the bottom! Nice employees, respectful attitude! It's a huge plus that models have access to the account and can view the stats and monitor the work on the account on their own! Few agencies work and treat models this well! Thank you!
